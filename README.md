# React + TypeScript + Tailwind + Vitest Starter

This is a minimal starter template for React with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vitest for testing. It's designed for practicing and learning.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/farhanabsar21/simple-react-typescript-starter.git

or for any specific folder
git clone https://github.com/farhanabsar21/simple-react-typescript-starter.git <your folder name>
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

```bash
cd simple-react-typescript-starter or your-folder
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Install the required dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the necessary packages for the project, including React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Vitest.

### 4. Run the Development Server

Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Run Tests

To run tests using Vitest, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

### 6. Customize & Practice

Feel free to start modifying the src/App.tsx and other components to practice React, TypeScript, and Tailwind. The current setup is minimal, so you can easily add new components, features, and tests.
